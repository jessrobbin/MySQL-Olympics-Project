Challenge began with Installing a local mySQL database and Importing data and setting up a schema.

[Creating the Olympics Table](https://github.com/jessrobbin/Olympics-Project/blob/main/Creating%20Olympics%20Table.sql) - Making the mock table in SQL and inserting data from csv.

[Creating New Tables & Adding Keys](https://github.com/jessrobbin/Olympics-Project/blob/main/Creating%20New%20Tables%20%26%20Adding%20Keys.sql) - Splitting up the table into a star schema and creating ID columns for each. Assigning these ID columns as primary keys.
